# Streetception
How safe or attractive do different people perceive streets to be and why?

We conducted a study with 403 participants and asked them to virtually navigate city streets in Frankfurt, Germany, through a sequence of street-level images, rate locations based on how safe or attractive they perceive them to be, and explain their ratings in their own words. Our results contribute new insights regarding the key similarities and differences between the factors influencing perceived safety and attractiveness.

In this repository we share the code we used for the analysis of the data used in the paper "Is it safe to be attractive? Disentangling the influence of streetscape features on the perceived safety and attractiveness of city streets".
