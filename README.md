### How safe or attractive do different people perceive streets to be and why?

#### In this repository we share the code we used for the analysis of the data used in the paper "Is it safe to be attractive? Disentangling the influence of streetscape features on the perceived safety and attractiveness of city streets".


City streets that feel safe and attractive motivate active travel behaviour and promote peopleâ€™s well-being. However, determining what makes a street safe and attrac- tive is a challenging task because subjective qualities of the streetscape are difficult to quantify. Existing evidence typically focuses on how different street features influ- ence perceived safety or attractiveness, but little is known about what influences both. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a crowdsourcing tool and conducted a study with 403 participants, who were asked to virtually navi- gate city streets in Frankfurt, Germany, through a sequence of street-level images, rate locations based on perceived safety and attractiveness, and explain their ratings. Our re- sults contribute new insights regarding the key similari- ties and differences between the factors influencing per- ceived safety and attractiveness. We show that the presence of human activity is strongly related to perceived safety, whereas attractiveness is influenced primarily by aesthetic qualities, as well as the number and type of amenities along a street. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of construction sites and underpasses has a disproportion- ately negative impact on perceived safety and attractive- ness, outweighing the influence of any other features. We use the results to make evidence-informed recommenda- tions for designing safer and more attractive streets that encourage active travel modes and promote well-being.
